The need to allign text in the logo row drives you to use flex.
Rows by default are "flex" giving you access to the allign and justify 
features.  justify-content-start is the default, and is used here for clarity.

Justify and allign also can use breakpoints to format the display differently
for different screen sizes.

    ex: justify-content-sm-end   -- this will justify the content to the right 
        for small and larger devices.
